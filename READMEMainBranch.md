### 1️⃣ C# Best Practices

#### 🔹 StringBuilder
**Use Case:**  
Used when performing **multiple string operations** such as concatenation, insertion, or modification—especially inside loops.

**Why StringBuilder?**
- `string` is immutable → creates new objects every time
- `StringBuilder` is mutable → better memory & performance

**Best Practices:**
- Prefer over `string` in performance-critical scenarios
- Use `Append()` instead of `+`
- Initialize with capacity when size is known

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 📄 CSV File Operations
- Created and used multiple CSV files:
  - `students.csv`
  - `users.csv`
  - `employees.csv`
  - `big.csv`
- Read CSV data using:
  - `File.ReadAllLines()`
  - `StreamReader`
- Wrote structured data into CSV files using:
  - `File.WriteAllLines()`
  - `StreamWriter`
- Counted records excluding the header row.

---

### 🔍 Data Processing & Logic
- Filtered CSV records based on conditions (e.g., students with marks > 80).
- Searched records by specific fields (employee name).
- Updated CSV data (10% salary increment for IT department).
- Sorted records by salary and extracted top 5 highest-paid employees.
- Detected duplicate records using LINQ grouping.

---

### 🧪 Data Validation
- Validated **Email** format using Regular Expressions.
- Validated **Phone Numbers** (exactly 10 digits).
- Printed invalid CSV rows with appropriate error identification.

---

### 🔄 CSV ↔ JSON Conversion
- Converted `students.json` → `students.csv`.
- Converted `students.csv` → `students_from_csv.json`.
- Resolved .NET 8 JSON serialization issues using:
  - `DefaultJsonTypeInfoResolver`.

---

### 🚀 Performance Handling
- Implemented **memory-efficient reading** for large CSV files (500MB+).
- Processed CSV data in chunks of **100 lines** using `StreamReader`.

---

### 🔐 Security (Encryption & Decryption)
- Implemented **AES encryption and decryption**.
- Encrypted sensitive fields such as:
