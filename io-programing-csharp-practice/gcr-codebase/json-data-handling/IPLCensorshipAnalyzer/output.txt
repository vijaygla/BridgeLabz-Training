The .NET 10.0 framework is not a valid or supported target framework. The latest Long Term Support (LTS) version is .NET 8.0, and the current stable version is also .NET 8.0.

Could you please clarify what you mean by "set my project at version 10"?
    
If you intended to target .NET 8.0, the project is already configured for that. If you meant something else, please provide more details.
